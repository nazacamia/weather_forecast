# weather_forecast

A new application for weather forecast in London

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

When the App is launched, It automatically downloads next five days weather’s forecast.

The App is made by a single page (HomeScreen) in which there are:
- main card:
	It contains today’s weather main info
- secondary card:
	- it contains today’s and next four days weather’s forecast
	- Tap a single row (day) to open that day’s forecast for given time intervals
- Floating action button:
	- Tap to download and refresh data

If I had more time I would’ve implemented LocalStorage and SharedPreferences management,
 some animations in order to make user experience smoother and optimized the UI.
